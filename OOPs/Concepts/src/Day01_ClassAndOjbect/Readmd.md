# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice Notes

**Learner:** Sharwan Jung Kunwar
**Language:** Java
**Coverage:** Day 01

## 📘 Day 01 — Class & Object

### 🔹 Core Concepts

* **Class**: Blueprint or template that defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods).
* **Object**: Real instance of a class created using `new` keyword.
* **Instance Variables**: Variables that belong to an object.
* **Methods**: Define behavior of an object.

> **OOP Rule:** Data should live inside objects, and methods should act on that data.

---

### 🔹 Key Points Learned

* Objects have **separate memory**.
* Changing one object does **not affect** another.
* Non-static methods **require an object reference**.
* `main()` is static, so it cannot directly access instance members.

---

### 🔹 Common Mistake (Avoid)

❌ Passing data into methods instead of storing it inside the object.

✅ Correct approach:

* Assign values to object variables.
* Let methods use those variables.

---

### 🔹 Interview-Level Takeaway

> Objects store **state**, methods define **behavior**.
