# ✅ UNIT 01

## 1️⃣ Difference Between Data Type and Data Structure

| Data Type | Data Structure |
|------------|----------------|
| Defines the type of data | Organizes and stores data |
| Represents single value | Represents collection of values |
| Example: int, float, char | Example: array, stack, queue |

**Example:**  
- `int` → Data Type  
- `Array` → Data Structure

## 2️⃣ What is Linear Data Structure?

A **Linear Data Structure** stores data elements in sequential order.

Each element is connected to its previous and next element.

### Examples:
- Array  
- Stack  
- Queue  
- Linked List  

👉 Traversal is done in a single line.

---

## 3️⃣ What is Non-Linear Data Structure?

A **Non-Linear Data Structure** stores data in hierarchical or network form.

Elements are not arranged sequentially.

### Examples:
- Tree  
- Graph  

👉 One element can connect to multiple elements.

## 4️⃣ Real-Life Examples of Data Structures

- **Stack** → Stack of plates  
- **Queue** → Line in bank  
- **Tree** → Family tree  
- **Graph** → Road network (Google Maps)

## 5️⃣ Role of ADT (Abstract Data Type)

**ADT** defines:
- What operations can be performed  
- But not how they are implemented  

Example:  
Stack ADT → PUSH, POP  

👉 ADT focuses on behavior, not implementation.
