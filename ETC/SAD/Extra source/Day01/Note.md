# 📘 System Designing (5 Marks Answer)

## ✅ What is System Designing?

System Designing is the process of planning and defining the architecture, modules, components, interfaces, and data flow of a system before development begins.

It provides a blueprint of how the system will function and how different parts will interact with each other.

System design ensures:
- Proper system structure  
- Clear separation of modules  
- Efficient data handling  
- Smooth communication between components

# 🔹 Types of System Design

## 1️⃣ High-Level Design (HLD)

High-Level Design describes the overall architecture of the system.  
It gives a big-picture view of the system.

### HLD Includes:
- System architecture  
- Major modules and components  
- High-level database design  
- Data flow between modules  

👉 HLD explains **what the system will do**.

---

## 2️⃣ Low-Level Design (LLD)

Low-Level Design describes the detailed internal design of each component.

### LLD Includes:
- Class diagrams  
- Methods and functions  
- Algorithms  
- Detailed database structure  

👉 LLD explains **how the system works internally**.

# 🔥 Conclusion

System Designing is divided into two types:
- **HLD** → Overall system structure  
- **LLD** → Detailed implementation  

Both are essential for building an efficient and well-structured system.
