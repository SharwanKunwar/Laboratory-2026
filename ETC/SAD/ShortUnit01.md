# Unit 1: System Development Fundamentals

---

## a. The Systems Development Environment (9 Hrs)

### 1. Introduction
System Development is the structured process of planning, creating, testing, and maintaining information systems to solve organizational problems.

**Example:** Library Management System, Banking System

---

### 2. Modern Approach of System Analysis and Design
The modern approach emphasizes:
- User involvement
- Flexibility
- Faster development
- Reusability
- Iterative improvement

This approach allows continuous feedback and system updates.

---

### 3. Information System and Its Types
An Information System (IS) is a set of components that collect, process, store, and distribute information.

#### Types of Information Systems:
- **Transaction Processing System (TPS)** – Handles daily transactions
- **Management Information System (MIS)** – Provides reports for managers
- **Decision Support System (DSS)** – Supports decision-making
- **Executive Support System (ESS)** – Supports strategic planning
- **Office Automation System (OAS)** – Supports office work

---

### 4. Developing Information Systems
The development process includes:
1. Identifying problems
2. Requirement analysis
3. System design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

---

### 5. Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
SDLC is a framework that describes the phases involved in developing an information system.

#### Phases of SDLC:
1. Planning
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing
6. Maintenance

---

### 6. The Heart of the Systems Development Process
System Analysis and System Design are considered the heart of the development process because they define system requirements and structure.

---

### 7. Traditional Waterfall SDLC
The Waterfall model is a linear and sequential approach.

#### Characteristics:
- Each phase must be completed before the next
- No overlapping phases

#### Disadvantages:
- Inflexible
- Difficult to handle changes

---

### 8. Approaches for Improving Development
To overcome limitations of the Waterfall model:
- Prototyping
- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- Agile Methodologies
- CASE Tools

---

### 9. CASE Tools (Computer Aided Software Engineering)
CASE tools support system development activities by automating tasks.

**Benefits:**
- Improves productivity
- Reduces development time
- Improves software quality

---

### 10. Rapid Application Development (RAD)
RAD focuses on quick development using prototypes and user feedback.

**Used when:**
- Time is limited
- Requirements are well understood

---

### 11. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
SOA designs systems as a collection of independent services that communicate with each other.

**Benefits:**
- Reusability
- Scalability
- Easy maintenance

---

### 12. Agile Methodologies
Agile is an iterative and incremental development approach.

**Key Principles:**
- Customer collaboration
- Responding to change
- Working software

---

### 13. Extreme Programming (XP)
XP is an Agile methodology that focuses on:
- Pair programming
- Continuous testing
- Frequent feedback

---

### 14. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
OOAD models systems using objects and classes.

**Key Concepts:**
- Class
- Object
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

---

## b. The Origins of Software

### 1. Introduction
Software evolved from manual systems to modern interactive and web-based applications.

---

### 2. System Acquisition
System acquisition refers to obtaining software through:
1. In-house development
2. Purchasing off-the-shelf software
3. Outsourcing development

---

### 3. Reuse
Reuse means using existing software components or code.

**Benefits:**
- Saves time
- Reduces cost
- Improves reliability

---

## c. Managing the Information Systems Project

### 1. Introduction
Information Systems Project Management ensures successful system development within time and budget.

---

### 2. Managing Information Systems Project
Includes:
- Planning
- Organizing
- Staffing
- Controlling

---

### 3. Representing and Scheduling Project Plans
Common tools:
- Gantt Chart
- PERT Chart

These tools help track task duration and dependencies.

---

### 4. Using Project Management Software
Examples:
- Microsoft Project
- Jira
- Trello

**Purpose:**
- Monitor progress
- Manage resources
- Track risks
