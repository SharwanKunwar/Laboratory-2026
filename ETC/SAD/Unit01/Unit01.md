# Unit 1: System Development Fundamentals

---

## a. The Systems Development Environment (9 Hrs)

### 1. Introduction
System Development refers to the organized and systematic process of planning, analyzing, designing, implementing, testing, and maintaining information systems. It aims to solve business problems and improve organizational efficiency through the use of technology. A well-developed system helps organizations manage data, automate processes, and support decision-making.

*Example:* Library Management System, Hospital Management System, Banking System

---

### 2. Modern Approach of System Analysis and Design
The modern approach of system analysis and design focuses on flexibility, speed, and user participation. Unlike traditional methods, modern approaches emphasize continuous user feedback, incremental development, and adaptability to change. Systems are developed in small modules, allowing improvements and updates throughout the development process.

This approach is suitable for today’s dynamic business environment where requirements frequently change.

---

### 3. Information System and Its Types
An Information System (IS) is an organized combination of people, hardware, software, data, and procedures that collects, processes, stores, and distributes information to support operations, management, and decision-making in an organization.

#### Types of Information Systems:
- *Transaction Processing System (TPS):* Handles routine daily transactions such as sales, billing, and payroll.
- *Management Information System (MIS):* Provides summarized reports to help managers in planning and controlling activities.
- *Decision Support System (DSS):* Assists managers in making semi-structured and complex decisions.
- *Executive Support System (ESS):* Supports top-level executives in strategic decision-making.
- *Office Automation System (OAS):* Supports office activities such as documentation, communication, and scheduling.

### 4. Developing Information Systems
Developing an information system involves a series of structured activities. The process begins with identifying organizational problems and understanding user requirements. After analysis, the system is designed, developed, tested, and implemented. Finally, the system is maintained to ensure it continues to function effectively and adapts to new requirements.

---

### 5. Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
The Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic framework that defines the phases involved in developing an information system. It provides a disciplined approach to system development and ensures quality and efficiency.

#### Phases of SDLC:
1. Planning – Identifying objectives and feasibility
2. Analysis – Understanding user requirements
3. Design – Creating system models and architecture
4. Implementation – Coding and system installation
5. Testing – Verifying system functionality
6. Maintenance – Updating and improving the system

---

### 6. The Heart of the Systems Development Process
System Analysis and System Design are considered the heart of the systems development process. Analysis focuses on understanding what the system should do, while design focuses on how the system will do it. Errors in these phases can lead to system failure, increased cost, and user dissatisfaction.

---

### 7. Traditional Waterfall SDLC
The Waterfall Model is a traditional and sequential approach to system development where each phase must be completed before moving to the next phase. It is easy to understand and manage, making it suitable for small and stable projects.

#### Disadvantages:
- Lack of flexibility
- Difficult to incorporate changes once development starts
- Not suitable for complex and dynamic systems

---

### 8. Approaches for Improving Development
To overcome the limitations of the Waterfall model, several improved approaches are used. These approaches focus on flexibility, faster development, and better user involvement.

Examples include:
- Prototyping
- Rapid Application Development (RAD)
- Agile Methodologies
- CASE Tools

---

### 9. CASE Tools (Computer Aided Software Engineering)
CASE tools are software applications that support and automate various activities of the system development process. They help in system analysis, design, coding, testing, and documentation.

*Advantages of CASE Tools:*
- Improves developer productivity
- Reduces development time and cost
- Enhances software quality and consistency

---

### 10. Rapid Application Development (RAD)
Rapid Application Development (RAD) is an approach that emphasizes quick system development using prototypes and continuous user feedback. It reduces development time and improves user satisfaction by involving users throughout the development process.

RAD is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and tight deadlines.

---

### 11. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a design approach in which a system is built as a collection of independent and reusable services. Each service performs a specific function and communicates with other services through standard interfaces.

*Benefits of SOA:*
- Reusability of services
- Scalability
- Easy integration and maintenance

---

### 12. Agile Methodologies
Agile methodologies follow an iterative and incremental approach to system development. Agile focuses on customer collaboration, continuous improvement, and rapid delivery of working software. Changes are welcomed even at later stages of development.

---

### 13. Extreme Programming (XP)
Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile methodology that emphasizes technical excellence and customer satisfaction. It promotes practices such as pair programming, continuous testing, frequent releases, and close communication with customers.

XP helps improve software quality and reduce development risks.

---

### 14. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) is a methodology that models a system using objects and classes. It focuses on real-world entities and their interactions, making systems easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

*Key Concepts of OOAD:*
- Class and Object
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## b. The Origins of Software

### 1. Introduction
Software has evolved over time from simple manual and batch-processing systems to complex, interactive, and web-based applications. This evolution has been driven by advancements in hardware, user requirements, and business needs.

---

### 2. System Acquisition
System acquisition refers to the process of obtaining an information system. Organizations can acquire systems through in-house development, purchasing ready-made software, or outsourcing development to external vendors.

---

### 3. Reuse
Reuse involves using existing software components, modules, or code in new systems. It reduces development time and cost while improving software reliability and consistency.

---

## c. Managing the Information Systems Project

### 1. Introduction
Managing an Information Systems project involves planning, organizing, and controlling resources to ensure the successful completion of a system. Effective project management ensures that systems are delivered on time, within budget, and according to user requirements.

---

### 2. Managing Information Systems Project
Project management includes activities such as defining project scope, allocating resources, managing risks, monitoring progress, and coordinating team members. The project manager plays a key role in ensuring project success.

---

### 3. Representing and Scheduling Project Plans
Project plans are represented using tools such as Gantt charts and PERT charts. These tools help visualize tasks, timelines, dependencies, and resource allocation, making project control easier.

---

### 4. Using Project Management Software
Project management software such as Microsoft Project, Jira, and Trello is used to plan, schedule, and monitor project activities. These tools help track progress, manage tasks, and improve team collaboration.
