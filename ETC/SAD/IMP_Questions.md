## 7. Data Modeling and Conceptual Data Modeling (5 Marks)

### Definition of Data Modeling
**Data modeling** is the process of **creating a visual representation of data**, its structure, and relationships within an information system. It helps in understanding, organizing, and managing data effectively.

---

## Conceptual Data Modeling
**Conceptual data modeling** is a high-level representation of **business data and its relationships**. It focuses on **what data is needed** rather than how it will be stored or implemented.  

- It identifies **entities, attributes, and relationships**.  
- It is **independent of database technology**.  

**Example:**  
For a **Library System**:  

- **Entities:** Book, Member, Issue  
- **Attributes:**  
  - Book → BookID, Title, Author  
  - Member → MemberID, Name, Address  
  - Issue → IssueID, IssueDate, ReturnDate  
- **Relationships:**  
  - Member **borrows** Book  
  - Book **is issued in** Issue  

This can be shown in an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** to illustrate the connections between entities.

---
---

## 8. Normalization and Normal Forms (5 Marks)

## Definition of Normalization
**Normalization** is the process of **organizing data in a database** to reduce **redundancy and dependency**. It ensures data is stored efficiently and consistently.

---

## Normal Forms

### 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
- Data is in **tabular form** with **no repeating groups or arrays**.  
- Each column contains **atomic values**.  

**Example:**  

| StudentID | Name    | Subjects       |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 101       | Ram     | Math, Science  |
| 102       | Sita    | English, Nepali|

**1NF Conversion:** Split repeating subjects  

| StudentID | Name    | Subject  |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 101       | Ram     | Math     |
| 101       | Ram     | Science  |
| 102       | Sita    | English  |
| 102       | Sita    | Nepali   |

---

### 2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Already in **1NF**.  
- **No partial dependency** (non-key attributes depend on **whole primary key**).  

**Example:**  

If we have a table:  

| StudentID | Subject  | Teacher      |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 101       | Math     | Mr. Sharma   |
| 101       | Science  | Ms. Rai      |

- Here, **Teacher depends on Subject**, not whole key (StudentID + Subject).  
- **2NF Conversion:** Split into two tables  

**Student_Subject Table:**  

| StudentID | Subject  |
|-----------|----------|
| 101       | Math     |
| 101       | Science  |

**Subject_Teacher Table:**  

| Subject  | Teacher    |
|----------|-----------|
| Math     | Mr. Sharma|
| Science  | Ms. Rai   |

---

### 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Already in **2NF**.  
- **No transitive dependency** (non-key attributes depend **only on primary key**).  

**Example:**  

| StudentID | DeptID | DeptName  |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 101       | D01    | Science   |
| 102       | D02    | Arts      |

- DeptName depends on DeptID, not StudentID (transitive dependency).  
- **3NF Conversion:**  

**Student Table:**  

| StudentID | DeptID |
|-----------|--------|
| 101       | D01    |
| 102       | D02    |

**Department Table:**  

| DeptID | DeptName |
|--------|----------|
| D01    | Science  |
| D02    | Arts     |

---

✅ **Summary:**  
- **1NF:** Remove repeating groups  
- **2NF:** Remove partial dependency  
- **3NF:** Remove transitive dependency
